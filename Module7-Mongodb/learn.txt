        /*   here we would not use const but we will be using var as mongo db do not ES6 */ 
        here Collection is refereed as Table in Mysql
installing Mongo db
    npm install mongoose    
including mongo to our file
    const mongo = require('mongoose);
Making the schema of the database
    var student = new mongo.Schema({  // building the schema - > schema means defining the structure of the data base
        name:String,
        studentid:Number,
        college:String,
        email:String
    });
to work with the student Schema we must create a model so that we can work with it
    schemas are like the the table name in Mysql
    while we also create a model of that schema , it is similar to defining the a variable for using that table
    also their is _id by default added to our each entry  - >we can replace it with our _id also by defining it into our schemas
    var studentmodel = mongoose.model('student',studentSchema);
    var student = new studentmodel({id:1,name:"rishi",studentid:12,college:"UIT",email:"ash@gmail.com"})




// model is type of class 
// then we create the object of that class ( studentmodel) and then add values inside the class


NOw install mongodb to your system
    Mongodb server -> this will create the environment of the data base but we will not able to see the database
